          <p>
            Born and raised in Montreal, Canada. Since I was a little kid, I was
            fascinated by technology and games, also martial arts! During my
            teenage years, I had given coding a shot (HTML and CSS) but
            abandoned pretty quickly when I saw that I was out of ideas and
            didn't understand (lack of patience at that age :P). Life went on
            and I decided to go towards Science (Biochemistry in particular).
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating in 2014 with a BSc. in Honors Biochemistry, I came
            out of university ready to face the world! 5 years in, after going
            through several jobs, I was left lacking something, that feeling
            that I wasn't able to accomplish anything in my professional life.
            By the end of 2019, I saw a bootcamp program given by Concordia and
            took a leap of faith. From March 2020 to November 2020, I went
            through the trenches and graduated as a Full-Stack Web Developer,
            one of my most proudest moments in my life!
          </p>
          <p>
            Like I had mentioned before, I've been passionate about martial arts
            since I was a child and went to study Karate, Aikido, Boxing and
            finally Ving Tsun Kung Fu. I was able to compete internationally in
            China in 2018 with Team Canada for the World Wing Chun Competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also find me riding a bicycle during riding season and more
            recently, I took up my motorcycle license to be able to ride
            motorcycles as a newly-found hobby. Finally, I love Japan and its
            culture. I was able to visit twice and always came back home wanting
            more of it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am trying to apply my newly acquired skills into
            challenging projects within a company and also keep growing/learning
            many more interesting things in the industry. With the current stack
            that I know, I want to keep building projects that will refine these
            skills but any other language/framework/library is welcomed!
