          Born and raised in Montreal, Canada. Since I was a little kid, I was
          fascinated by technology and games, also martial arts! During my
          teenage years, I had given coding a shot (HTML and CSS) but abandoned
          pretty quickly when I saw that I was out of ideas and didn't
          understand (lack of patience at that age...). Life went on and I
          decided to go towards Science (Biochemistry in particular).

          After graduating in 2014 with a BSc. Honors in Biochemistry, I came
          out of university ready to face the world! 5 years in, after going
          through several jobs, I was left lacking something, that feeling that
          I wasn't able to accomplish anything in my professional life. By the
          end of 2019, I saw a bootcamp program given by Concordia and took a
          leap of faith. From March 2020 to November 2020, I went through the
          trenches and graduated as a Full-Stack Web Developer, one of my most
          proudest moments in my life!

          Like I had mentioned before, I've been passionate about martial arts
          since I was a child and went to study Karate, Aikido, Boxing and
          finally Ving Tsun Kung Fu. I was able to compete internationally in
          China in 2018 with Team Canada for the World Wing Chun Competition.

          You can also find me riding a bicycle during riding season and more
          recently, I acquired my motorcycle license to be able to ride
          motorcycles as a newfound hobby. Finally, I love Japan and its
          culture. I was able to visit twice and always came back home wanting
          more of it!

          Currently, I am trying to apply my newly acquired skills into
          challenging projects within a company and also keep growing/learning
          many more interesting things in the industry. With the current stack
          that I know, I want to keep building projects that will refine these
          skills but any other language/framework/library is welcomed!
